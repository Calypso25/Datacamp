## Project Description

_-_ The Client: Sedora

Sedora is a rapidly expanding online shopping busines. It has attracted lots of attention in Turkey and they are looking to expand to the european market. They accomplished all that based on understanding their clients and knowing what they want and when they want it

<p>&nbsp;</p>

_-_ What is missing

- They had  success until this point by knowing their local clients.
This success has proven very useful to keep the buisness blooming in Turkey but is not enough for the grand expansion that they plan.

- In order to make this expansion fireproof they need to secure some VC investment, but money doesnt come easy. They plan on convincing their new investors by proving they can secure sales and revenue by integrating a system that understand when people buy their products and what are the determing factors.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

_-_ The Objective

1. Build a machine learning product that is able to predict if a customer is going to make a purchase
2. Understand which were the determinig factors that pushed customers to make a purchase
3. Build a visual representation of the previous two points that Sedora can show the potential investors the results and impress them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

_-_ What is missing

- We are working with 12k rows of data collected from customers taht logged into the site
- This data contains some key factors like session time and if the customer was a returning customer or not
- The data is heavily skewed so make sure you find a solution that works for both situations, if they make a purchase or if they didn't.
